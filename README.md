# mandelburgh

A bit outdated but its a sandbox for generating complex fractals. I tried to mess around with parallel processing and stuff but it just doesn't make too much of a difference (unless I implemented things horribly wrong).


Also, if anyone was genuinely curious(!!), sorry for the mess. I made these under the assumption that only I would see the code.
