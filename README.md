# mandelburgh

A bit outdated but its a sandbox for generating fractals in the complex plane. I tried to mess around with parallel processing and stuff but it just doesn't make too much of a difference (unless I implemented things horribly wrong).

I would love to implement real-time functionality eventually, but that means that the image generation would need quite a massive speedup.

Also, if anyone was genuinely curious(!!), sorry for the mess. I made these under the assumption that only I would see the code. However, I do intend on cleaning this up.
